## SV-RegTool

# Description
This is a UI driven Single Variable Regression Tool made in python. This simple program allows users to select a single variable dataset (.csv) and have it and an adjustable regression model displayed. It will also allow users to query the model for predictions once the model is prepared.

# Purpose
There are other, far better options than this software. The purpose of this software is for me to better understand Python user interface tools and reinforce my understanding of regression.
